Hello! My name is Natasha, and this is a personal blog where I keep records of any projects or knowledge relating to my studies in the IT and cyber security fields that I undertake throughout my university degree or in my personal time.

I enjoy learning about interesting concepts and practices in the IT and cyber security field. I use this blog to convey challenging concepts in an easy-to-understand way while also documenting the new knowledge and skills that I come across during my studies.

This blog also acts as a way for me to improve my writing and documenting skills while also expanding my technical and problem-solving skills through undertaking small cyber-related projects.
