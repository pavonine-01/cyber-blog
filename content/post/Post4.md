A vulnerability scanner is a tool that automatically checks if the network or application it is scanning has any security weaknesses that could potentially be exploited by attackers.

Security vulnerabilities, whether on an individual device or across an entire network, can only be effectively handled once they have been discovered. A vulnerability scanner can be used to discover these vulnerabilities so that they can be patched, therefore reducing the likelihood of future breaches.

The process of vulnerability management does not stop or start with simply scanning the system or network, further steps need to be taken to treat the identified vulnerabilities, and report back to human admins on how they have been handled.

The effectiveness of the vulnerability scanner, however, is dependent on it's ability to apply the information it has found from scanning a system with information it knows from one or more vulnerability databases.

## Resources Needed

To undertake this project, the scanning software **Nessus**, created by the cyber security company Tenable, will be used. As a test, the Nessus software will scan for vulnerabilities on virtual machines with known vulnerabilities. Additionally, the vulnerability scanner will then be used on my home network.

Nessus offers a free version called **Nessus Essentials** aimed at students and hobbyists, which scans up to 16 IP addresses. A download link can be found [here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).

A virtual machine with vulnerabilities can be downloaded from SourceForge, linked [here](https://sourceforge.net/directory/os:windows/?q=vulnerable+machine).

## What can Vulnerability Scanners identify?

The scanner should be able to gather basic system information, such as the operating system being used, or what software and applications are installed. The scanner will also be able to look **need to finish sentence**.
