Personal Cloud with Raspberry Pi
* Cloud Computing Skills Practiced: Linux, Programming

This project helps students understand how cloud servers operate. First, you will build a personal cloud server using the Raspberry Pi board. You will need a hard disk, Micro SD cards, and an Internet connection for this project. Finally, you will install the right cloud software, such as DietPi, input your IP address, access cloud servers, and synchronize your folders.

Donâ€™t forget you can store your data in public or private clouds, depending on your preference. Once that is done, you will then have access to your folders from anywhere in the world. Using Linux also allows you to access cloud servers on a wide range of devices, and it stores large data sets.
