With the latest news from Sony - confirming the lack of reliable playstation 5 stock into the next year - and after weeks of searching and hoping to get lucky and purchase myself a console, I decided to take matters into my own hands. As a result, I am going to attempt to build a bot to automatically purchase a PS5 for myself.
