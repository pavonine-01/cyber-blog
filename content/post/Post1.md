The newest console from Sony, the Playstation 5, has been difficult to purchase due to a global manufacturing components shortage, where there is a lack of reliable supply of semiconductor chips necessary to manufacture these consoles.

The lack of reliable playstation 5 stock has lead to a "scalping problem", where re-sellers use "bots" to instantly purchase these consoles and then sell them at absurd markup prices. This causes retailers such as Big W, JB Hi-Fi or EB Games to immediately go out of stock, making it impossible for the average customer to purchase one at retail price, with a warranty and all of their consumer rights.

With the latest news from Sony confirming the lack of readily available playstation 5 stock into the next year, and after weeks of searching and hoping to get lucky and purchase a console for myself, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I am going to build a bot to automatically purchase a PS5 for myself.

## What is a bot?

A 'bot' is a program that is written to perform a specific task. Bots are used all over the internet to do a variety of good and important tasks, such as 'web crawlers' which scan content on webpages. Bots can also be used to perform a number of different malicious actions, such as spread spam content or carry out Denial-of-Service attacks. Bots can pose a cyber security risk both to organisations and individuals.

In the case of the Playstation 5 console, people colloquially called 'scalpers' have been creating bots to instantly bulk purchase these consoles the moment they become available at retailers, at speeds which the average human buyer cannot hope to match.

The only way to purchase a Playstation 5 console for myself, while competing with bots, is to build a bot of my own.
